## 2. Core Capabilities & Components

### 2.1 Backend Orchestrator

**Purpose:** Centralized Node.js server managing video playback, sessions, and real-time state synchronization.

**Key Services:**

| Service | Capability | Business Value |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Session Management** | Create/pause/resume/end event sessions | Single source of truth for game state |
| **Transaction Processing** | Score token scans, detect duplicates, calculate bonuses | Real-time competitive mechanics |
| **Video Queue Management** | Sequential video playback on shared display | Coordinated narrative delivery |
| **VLC Integration** | Hardware-accelerated H.264 playback | Professional video quality on budget hardware |
| **Offline Queue** | Cache scans during connectivity loss, sync on recovery | Zero data loss guarantee |
| **Persistence** | Disk-based session storage, automatic backup | Event recovery after crashes |
| **Discovery Service** | UDP broadcast auto-detection | Plug-and-play device connection |
| **Device Coordination** | Track all connected scanners, heartbeat monitoring | Real-time operations dashboard |

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services emit domain events, state service aggregates, WebSocket broadcasts to clients
- **Computed State Pattern**: GameState always derived from Session (eliminates sync bugs on restart)
- **Contract Validation**: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI contracts tested via automated test suite

### 2.2 Scanner Applications

#### Player Scanner (Participant-Facing)

**Purpose:** Progressive Web App for participants to discover and scan tokens independently.

**Capabilities:**
- RFID scanning via ESP32 or mobile Web NFC API
- Local media playback (images, audio) from bundled token database
- Video playback trigger (orchestrator queues video on shared screen)
- Offline mode: Queues scans to IndexedDB, syncs when reconnected
- Standalone deployment: Works via GitHub Pages without orchestrator

**User Experience:**
1. Participant finds physical token in game space
2. Scans token with tablet/phone
3. App displays image/plays audio immediately (local assets)
4. If token contains video: Video queued to orchestrator-controlled screen
5. If offline: Scan cached, will sync later with zero data loss

**Deployment Models:**
- **Networked:** Served from orchestrator at `https://[IP]:3000/player-scanner/`
- **Standalone:** GitHub Pages deployment with bundled token data

#### GM Scanner (Facilitator Interface)

**Purpose:** Real-time WebSocket-driven interface for game facilitators (GMs).

**Capabilities:**
- **NFC Scanning** (requires HTTPS + Web NFC API)
- **Dual Scoring Modes:**
  - **Black Market Mode**: Full scoring with multipliers, group bonuses, competitive leaderboard
  - **Detective Mode**: Zero-points logging for narrative tracking only
- **Real-Time State Sync**: Instant updates of scores, transactions, video status across all GMs
- **Admin Controls**: Create sessions, pause/resume gameplay, video control, score adjustments
- **Device Coordination View**: See all connected scanners, connection health, heartbeat status

**User Experience:**
1. GM authenticates with JWT token from orchestrator
2. WebSocket connection auto-syncs complete game state
3. Player approaches with collected token, GM scans it
4. Transaction submitted → Server processes → Points awarded
5. All other GMs see score update instantly
6. If group completed: Bonus celebration triggers on all screens

**Authentication Flow:**
1. HTTP POST to `/api/admin/auth` with password → Receive JWT
2. WebSocket connect with JWT in `handshake.auth`
3. Server validates token at connection time (not per-message)
4. Success: Device registered, `sync:full` auto-sent, broadcasts begin
5. Failure: Connection rejected with transport-level error

### 2.3 Token Data Architecture

**Token Definition Model:**

```javascript
{
  "534e2b03": {
    "SF_RFID": "534e2b03",           // Unique token ID (RFID tag)
    "SF_ValueRating": 3,              // 1-5 scoring weight
    "SF_MemoryType": "Technical",     // Personal | Business | Technical
    "SF_Group": "jaw_group",          // Group completion tracking
    "image": "assets/images/token.jpg",
    "audio": "assets/audio/narr.mp3",
    "video": "memory-fragment.mp4",   // Filename only (in backend/public/videos/)
    "processingImage": "loading.jpg"  // Display while video loads
  }
}
```

**Submodule Synchronization Pattern:**

The system uses Git submodules to distribute token data across three access points:

```
ALN-Ecosystem/ (Parent Repository)
├── ALN-TokenData/ [SUBMODULE]      ← Single source of truth
│   ├── tokens.json
│   └── assets/ (images, audio)
│
├── backend/
│   └── src/services/tokenService.js → Loads from ../../ALN-TokenData/
│
├── aln-memory-scanner/ [SUBMODULE]
│   └── data/ [NESTED SUBMODULE → ALN-TokenData]
│
└── ALNScanner/ [SUBMODULE]
    └── data/ [NESTED SUBMODULE → ALN-TokenData]
```

**Benefits:**
- Update tokens once, all modules sync automatically
- Scanners can deploy to GitHub Pages with bundled token database
- Backend always loads from canonical source
- `npm run sync:quick` updates all modules in one command

### 2.4 Scoreboard Display

**Purpose:** TV-optimized read-only display for public scoreboards, event leaderboards.

**Features:**
- Hardcoded admin authentication (no UI login)
- WebSocket read-only connection (receives broadcasts, can't send commands)
- Live Black Market rankings (team scores with multipliers)
- Group completion celebrations
- Detective log (narrative events made public)

**Deployment:** Served at `https://[IP]:3000/scoreboard`, connects as admin WebSocket client

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Integration Patterns

#### Contract-First API Design

**Philosophy:** Define interfaces first, implement second, test against contracts.

**Components:**
- **OpenAPI Contract** (`backend/contracts/openapi.yaml`): 7 HTTP endpoints with request/response schemas
- **AsyncAPI Contract** (`backend/contracts/asyncapi.yaml`): 14 WebSocket events with payload schemas
- **Contract Tests**: Automated validation that implementations match specifications

**Breaking Change Protocol:**
1. Update contract first (version bump if breaking)
2. Update backend implementation
3. Update scanner submodules (coordinated release)
4. Run contract test suite to validate alignment

**Benefit:** Scanners and backend can be developed independently against guaranteed interface.

#### Network Discovery Mechanism

**Problem Solved:** Traditional network setup requires router configuration, static IPs, DNS.

**Solution:** UDP broadcast discovery on port 8888

**Flow:**
1. Orchestrator starts listening on UDP port 8888
2. Scanner broadcasts: `ALN_DISCOVER`
3. Orchestrator responds: `{service: 'ALN_ORCHESTRATOR', port: 3000, addresses: ['10.0.0.100', ...]}`
4. Scanner auto-configures to `https://10.0.0.100:3000`
5. Fallback: Manual IP entry if UDP blocked

**Benefit:** Works on any network (venue WiFi, mobile hotspot, direct Ethernet) without IT support.

#### Offline Capabilities

**Dual Queue System:**

**1. Player Scan Queue (HTTP-based):**
- Scanner detects orchestrator offline (POST to `/api/scan` fails)
- Queues scans to IndexedDB (max 100 items)
- Persists to disk (survives browser close)
- On reconnect: POST `/api/scan/batch` uploads all queued scans
- Response includes per-scan status (video queued or already played)

**2. GM Transaction Queue (WebSocket-based):**
- WebSocket disconnects (network failure, server restart)
- GM scanner queues transactions locally
- On reconnect: Re-submits all queued transactions via `transaction:submit`
- Server re-processes, deduplicates, broadcasts updated scores

**Guarantees:**
- Zero data loss even with prolonged offline periods
- Eventual consistency on reconnection
- Max queue size prevents memory exhaustion

#### Real-Time State Synchronization

**Anti-Pattern Avoided:** HTTP polling for state updates

**Pattern Used:** Server-push via WebSocket with event-driven coordination

**Internal Event Flow:**
```
Domain Event (Service)
  ↓
Event Listener (stateService)
  ↓
State Recomputation (getCurrentState())
  ↓
WebSocket Broadcast (broadcasts.js wraps in envelope)
  ↓
All Clients Receive {event, data, timestamp}
```

**Example: Token Scan Flow**
```
Player POST /api/scan
  ↓
Backend processes, logs transaction
  ↓
transactionService.emit('transaction:accepted')
  ↓
stateService hears event → recomputes state → emit('state:updated')
  ↓
broadcasts.js wraps as sync:full event
  ↓
Socket.io broadcasts to 'gm-stations' room
  ↓
All GM scanners receive updated state (scores, transactions, video status)
```

**Performance:**
- 100ms debounce on state updates (prevents thundering herd)
- Single broadcast per transaction (not one per client)
- ETag caching for HTTP GET /api/state (debug endpoint)

### 3.2 Technology Stack

**Traditional Event Platforms:**
- Eventbrite, Hopin, Airmeet: Virtual/hybrid events, no physical interaction
- Scavenger hunt apps: GPS-based, no RFID, no video orchestration
- Museum guide systems: Audio tours, no competitive mechanics
- Escape room control systems: Proprietary, not extensible

**ALN Ecosystem Differentiation:**

| Feature | ALN Ecosystem | Traditional Platforms |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Physical Token Interaction** | RFID/NFC required | QR codes or GPS only |
| **Coordinated Video Playback** | Centralized VLC control | Individual device playback |
| **Real-Time Multi-Device Sync** | WebSocket broadcasts | HTTP polling or none |
| **Offline Operation** | Full gameplay, syncs later | Requires connectivity |
| **Network Flexibility** | Works on any network | Requires static IPs/DNS |
| **Competitive Scoring** | Real-time leaderboard | Post-event scoring |
| **Open Architecture** | Contract-first APIs | Proprietary/closed |

### 5.2 Technical Advantages

**1. Contract-First Architecture**

**Benefit:** Independent development of backend and scanner modules.

**Example:**
- Theater company develops custom scanner for accessibility
- Uses OpenAPI spec to build HTTP client
- Guaranteed interface compatibility
- No backend code changes required

**2. Graceful Degradation**

**Benefit:** Event continues even with connectivity loss.

**Scenario:**
```
T+0:30 - Venue WiFi crashes during peak play

**4. Submodule Architecture**

**Benefit:** Single token database update propagates to all deployment targets.

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Event designer updates tokens
cd ALN-TokenData
vim tokens.json  # Add new token
git add tokens.json
git commit -m "Add token for Act 2"
git push

# Update all modules
cd ../  # Parent repo
npm run sync:quick  # Updates backend + 2 scanner submodules
git push

# GitHub Pages scanners automatically rebuild
# Backend restarts, loads new tokens
# Zero downtime if using blue-green deployment
```

### 5.3 Production-Readiness

**Validated at Scale:**
- 50-200 concurrent participants
- 2-4 hour event duration
- 500+ token scans per event

## 6. Use Cases

### 6.1 Priority Use Case: Corporate Team Building via Best Corporate Events

**Target Partnership:** Best Corporate Events/SmartHunts® (market leader, est. $10M+ annual revenue from scavenger hunts)

**Offering:** "SmartHunts® Legacy Edition" or "Artifact Quest by Best Corporate Events"

**Event Scenario: "Corporate Values Quest"**

**Client Example:** Fortune 500 tech company, annual leadership retreat, 200 participants
- **Budget:** $60,000 total ($300/person premium tier vs. $120 standard SmartHunts®)
- **Duration:** 3-hour team building activity
- **Teams:** 20 teams of 10 people each
- **Tokens:** 15 custom-branded RFID tokens representing company values (Innovation, Customer Focus, Integrity, etc.)

**System Deployment:**
- **Orchestrator:** Raspberry Pi 4 on corporate WiFi (auto-discovery via UDP)
- **Player Scanners:** 20 iPads (participants' personal devices via Web NFC)
- **GM Scanners:** 3 iPads for Best Corporate Events facilitators (NFC-enabled)
- **Admin Panel:** Event producer laptop
- **Scoreboard TV:** Conference room display (live leaderboard)
- **Video TV:** Main auditorium screen (VLC-orchestrated narrative videos)

**Token Design:**

- Packaging: Velvet display box (trophy keepsake for participants)
- Videos: 15 custom 60-second videos featuring C-suite executives explaining each value
- Scoring: Each token worth 100-1000 points based on "difficulty to find"

**Event Flow:**
1. **Pre-Event (T-1 week):** Best Corporate Events hides 15 tokens around hotel convention center
2. **Kickoff (T+0:00):** Facilitator creates session, explains rules, teams disperse
3. **Hunt Phase (T+0:00 to T+2:30):** Teams explore hotel, scan tokens with phones, videos play on main screen when discovered
4. **Scoring Phase (T+2:30 to T+2:45):** GMs scan tokens brought by teams, real-time leaderboard updates
5. **Wrap-Up (T+2:45 to T+3:00):** Winner announced, all participants receive trophy token set in branded box

**Key Differentiators vs. Standard SmartHunts® GPS:**
- ✅ **Physical Keepsakes:** Participants keep metal tokens in display boxes (vs. deleted app)
- ✅ **Indoor Reliability:** Convention center ballrooms work perfectly (GPS fails indoors)
- ✅ **Shared Storytelling:** Teams gather to watch exec videos on main screen (vs. isolating on phones)
- ✅ **HR Analytics:** Session export with engagement metrics for leadership development tracking

## 7. Implementation Gaps for Generic Use

**CRITICAL SECTION FOR INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS**

This section identifies architectural constraints and hardcoded game logic that must be addressed before the platform can serve non-About Last Night use cases.

### 7.1 Hardcoded Game-Specific Logic

#### Gap 1: Scoring System

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// backend/src/config/index.js:70-83

// Value rating to points mapping (hardcoded)
valueRatingMap: {
  1: 100,      // Low-value token
  2: 500,
  3: 1000,
  4: 5000,
  5: 10000     // High-value token
}

// Type multipliers (hardcoded About Last Night theme)
typeMultipliers: {
  personal: 1.0,    // Personal memory = 1x points
  business: 3.0,    // Business memory = 3x points
  technical: 5.0    // Technical memory = 5x points (highest value)
}
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot support arbitrary scoring models
- Other games need different value ranges (e.g., 1-10 scale, percentage-based)
- Multipliers are theme-specific ("personal/business/technical" meaningless outside ALN)

**Recommendation:**
- **Externalize to token metadata**: Each token defines its own point value
- **Remove type multipliers**: Replace with generic "category" field
- **Scoring formula API**: Allow custom JavaScript functions per event
- **Example:** `scoreFunction: (token) => token.baseValue * token.rarityMultiplier`

#### Gap 2: Two Scanning Modes (Detective vs. Black Market)

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// backend/src/services/transactionService.js

const points = (transaction.mode === 'detective') ? 0 : calculatePoints(token);

// Detective mode → narrative logging, 0 points
// Black Market mode → full scoring with multipliers
```

**Impact:**
- Limited to binary choice (score or don't score)
- Cannot support games with multiple scoring modes (e.g., "easy/medium/hard" difficulties)
- Mode selection baked into GM Scanner UI

**Recommendation:**
- **Configurable game modes**: Define N modes per session with distinct rules
- **Mode metadata**: Each mode specifies scoring formula, rules, UI behavior
- **Example modes:**
  - "Competitive" → Full scoring, leaderboard visible
  - "Cooperative" → Team progress bar, no rankings
  - "Tutorial" → 0 points, educational feedback only

#### Gap 3: Group Completion Bonuses

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// Tokens have groupId field
"SF_Group": "jaw_group"

// Backend checks if all tokens in group scanned by same team
if (allTokensInGroupScanned(teamId, groupId)) {
  awardBonus(teamId, groupBonusPoints);
  broadcast('group:completed', {teamId, group: groupId});
}
```

**Impact:**
- "Completion" definition is hardcoded (all tokens in group)
- Cannot support partial bonuses (e.g., "3 of 5 tokens = partial bonus")
- Cannot support cross-team group bonuses (collaborative completion)

**Recommendation:**
- **Flexible completion rules**: JSON-based rule definitions
- **Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "groupId": "artifact_set",
    "completionRule": "any 3 of 5",
    "bonusPerToken": 100,
    "fullSetBonus": 500
  }
  ```
- **Support collaborative groups**: Multiple teams contribute to same group completion

#### Gap 4: Duplicate Detection Window

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// backend/src/config/index.js:44
duplicateWindow: 5  // seconds
```

**Impact:**
- Fixed 5-second window may be too short/long for other games
- Some events WANT duplicates to count (e.g., "scan this token every 10 minutes for bonus")

**Recommendation:**
- **Configurable per session**: Admin sets duplicate policy on session creation
- **Options:**
  - "No duplicates allowed" (current behavior)
  - "Allow duplicates after N seconds" (configurable window)
  - "Allow unlimited duplicates" (re-scan for repeated bonuses)

### 7.2 Session & Configuration Constraints

#### Gap 5: Single Active Session Limit

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// backend/src/services/sessionService.js:52
if (this.currentSession && this.currentSession.isActive()) {
  await this.endSession();  // Can only have ONE session
}
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot run concurrent events (e.g., tournament bracket with 4 simultaneous sessions)
- Cannot support multi-day events with overlapping schedules
- Limits use cases to single-event-at-a-time scenarios

**Recommendation:**
- **Multi-session support**: Session ID becomes primary key, not singleton
- **Session isolation**: Devices join specific session by ID
- **Admin UI**: Session picker (create new, join existing, switch sessions)
- **Database migration**: Replace `currentSession` with `sessions: Map<sessionId, Session>`

#### Gap 6: Hardcoded Team Format

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// Teams must be 3-digit zero-padded strings
teamId: "001", "002", "003"

// Pattern validation enforced
pattern: '^[0-9]{3}$'
```

**Impact:**
- Cannot use named teams ("Red Team", "Blue Team")
- Limited to 999 teams (unlikely to hit this limit, but inflexible)
- Team creation must happen at session start (cannot add teams dynamically)

**Recommendation:**
- **Flexible team IDs**: Support alphanumeric, human-readable names
- **Dynamic team creation**: Add/remove teams during active session
- **Team metadata**: Colors, logos, custom properties

#### Gap 7: Session Timeout Configuration

**Current Implementation:**

```javascript
// backend/src/config/index.js:45
sessionTimeout: 120  // minutes (2 hours, hardcoded default)
```

**Impact:**
- 2-hour limit may be too short for all-day events
- No way to create "infinite" sessions (museum exhibit running for weeks)

**Recommendation:**
- **Per-session timeout**: Set timeout on session creation
- **Optional timeout**: `sessionTimeout: null` for no expiration
- **Warning system**: Alert admin 10 minutes before timeout

### 7.3 UI/Branding Limitations

#### Gap 8: Hardcoded Branding

**Current Locations:**

1. **Admin Panel HTML**:
   ```html
   <!-- backend/public/scoreboard.html -->
   <title>About Last Night - Scoreboard</title>
   <h1>About Last Night Black Market Rankings</h1>
   ```

2. **Scanner Submodules**: (Not visible in parent repo, but exist)
   - Player scanner: ALN logo, color scheme
   - GM scanner: "Detective Mode" / "Black Market Mode" labels
   - Hardcoded UI strings

**Impact:**
- Cannot white-label for other clients
- Requires forking entire scanner modules for rebrand
- "About Last Night" visible to all users

**Recommendation:**
- **Template system**: Handlebars/EJS templates with variable injection
- **Branding config file**:
  ```json
  {
    "eventName": "About Last Night",
    "primaryColor": "#1a1a2e",
    "logo": "https://example.com/logo.png",
    "scoringModeLabels": {
      "mode1": "Detective Mode",
      "mode2": "Black Market Mode"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Scanner theming**: CSS variables for colors, fonts, spacing

#### Gap 9: Scoreboard Layout

**Current Implementation:**

```html
<!-- backend/public/scoreboard.html -->
<!-- Hardcoded HTML table for Black Market rankings -->
<table id="scoreboardTable">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Rank</th>
      <th>Team</th>
      <th>Score</th>
      <th>Groups Completed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>
```

**Impact:**
- Fixed layout cannot adapt to different event types
- Cannot show different metrics (e.g., "Time to Complete", "Accuracy %")

**Recommendation:**
- **Configurable scoreboard widgets**: Drag-and-drop layout builder
- **Metric selection**: Admin chooses which columns to display
- **Custom views**: "Leaderboard", "Team Progress", "Recent Activity"

### 7.4 Data Management Gaps

#### Gap 10: Token Data Management

**Current Implementation:**

- Tokens stored in Git submodule (`ALN-TokenData/tokens.json`)
- Editing requires:
  1. Clone repository
  2. Edit JSON manually
  3. Commit and push
  4. Update submodule references in parent + scanners
  5. Restart orchestrator
  6. Redeploy scanners to GitHub Pages

**Impact:**
- Non-technical event designers cannot add tokens
- Error-prone (manual JSON editing)
- Slow iteration (commit → push → deploy cycle)

**Recommendation:**
- **Admin token management UI**:
  - Create/edit/delete tokens via web form
  - Upload images/audio/videos (S3 or local storage)
  - Preview token before save
  - One-click publish to scanners
- **Database migration**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for token storage
- **Backward compatibility**: Export to JSON for scanner bundling

#### Gap 11: Media Library

**Current Implementation:**

- Videos manually placed in `backend/public/videos/`
- Images/audio in `ALN-TokenData/assets/`
- No inventory, no search, no metadata

**Impact:**
- Cannot see which videos are unused
- Cannot preview media without token scan
- File naming conflicts possible

**Recommendation:**
- **Media library admin panel**:
  - Upload with drag-and-drop
  - Preview video/audio/image in-browser
  - Tag media (genre, duration, event)
  - Usage analytics (which tokens use this video?)
- **CDN integration**: Offload media to S3/Cloudflare for scalability

### 7.5 Observability & Analytics Gaps

#### Gap 12: Session Analytics

**Current Implementation:**

- Session saved as JSON file on disk
- Basic metadata: `{gmStations: 2, playerDevices: 3, totalScans: 47}`
- No post-event analytics

**Impact:**
- Cannot answer questions like:
  - "Which tokens were most popular?"
  - "Average time between scans per team?"
  - "Which teams scanned together (collaboration patterns)?"
  - "Video engagement (did players watch full videos?)"

**Recommendation:**
- **Analytics dashboard**:
  - Token popularity heatmap
  - Team performance over time (line chart)
  - Device utilization (which scanners busiest?)
  - Video completion rates
- **Export options**: CSV, PDF report, Google Sheets integration
- **Real-time analytics**: During event, show live stats to admin

#### Gap 13: Audit Trail

**Current Implementation:**

- Transactions logged with timestamp
- Admin score adjustments logged (feature added recently)
- No comprehensive audit trail

**Impact:**
- Cannot replay event to debug issues
- Limited accountability for admin interventions

**Recommendation:**
- **Event sourcing pattern**: Store all events (scans, commands, errors)
- **Replay capability**: Reconstruct game state at any point in time
- **Audit log viewer**: Filter by device, team, time range

### 7.6 Integration & Extensibility Gaps

#### Gap 14: External System Integration

**Current Implementation:**

- Standalone system, no external APIs
- Cannot integrate with:
  - Payment systems (ticket validation)
  - CRM systems (participant data)
  - Learning management systems (education credits)
  - Social media (share scores)

**Impact:**
- Manual data entry for participant lists
- No automated follow-up (email results, certificates)

**Recommendation:**
- **Webhook system**: POST events to external URLs
- **OAuth integration**: Connect to Eventbrite, Salesforce, etc.
- **Zapier connector**: No-code integrations
- **Example webhook**:
  ```json
  POST https://customer-crm.com/webhooks/aln
  {
    "event": "session:completed",
    "sessionId": "abc-123",
    "winner": "Team 001",
    "participants": [...]
  }
  ```

#### Gap 15: Custom Scanner Development

**Current Capability:**

- Contract-first APIs enable custom scanner development
- Well-documented OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specs
- BUT: No SDK, no examples, no starter templates

**Impact:**
- High barrier to entry for custom scanner development
- Each developer must implement Socket.io authentication, offline queue, state sync

**Recommendation:**
- **JavaScript SDK**: `npm install @aln/scanner-sdk`
  ```javascript
  import { ALNScanner } from '@aln/scanner-sdk';

  const scanner = new ALNScanner({
    orchestratorURL: 'https://orchestrator.local:3000',
    deviceId: 'custom-scanner-1',
    deviceType: 'gm'
  });

  scanner.on('sync:full', (state) => {
    // Handle state update
  });

  scanner.submitTransaction({tokenId: '123', teamId: '001'});
  ```
- **Starter templates**: React, Vue, Svelte scanner examples
- **Developer documentation**: Step-by-step guide to building custom scanner

   - LinkedIn outreach: "Researching corporate team building for thesis/article"
   - Ask: "Last team building event you ran—what worked, what didn't?"
   - Probe: "Would you pay premium for physical keepsakes participants display?"
   - Validate: "$280/person for tokens + video vs. $120 for GPS app—worth it?"

2. **Gather Corporate Themes:**
   - Ask: "If tokens represented company values, which values would you choose?"
   - Examples to test: Leadership, Innovation, Customer Focus, Integrity, Collaboration
   - Output: 10-15 "corporate token themes" library (reusable across clients)

**Success Criteria (Go/No-Go Decision at Day 30):**
- ✅ **Proceed to Pilot:** Best Corporate Events responds positively + 3+ HR leaders validate premium pricing
- ⚠️ **Pivot Partner:** Best Corporate Events declines but HR leaders interested → approach Outback/TeamBonding
- ❌ **Pause:** No partner interest + HR leaders don't value tokens → reassess product-market fit

## 9. Conclusion

The **ALN Ecosystem** represents a production-ready foundation for RFID-based experiential events with demonstrated reliability at scale. Its contract-first architecture, graceful degradation, and network flexibility solve real pain points in the live event technology space.

**Key Strengths:**
- Proven at scale (50-200 participants, 2-4 hour events)
- Technical sophistication (event-driven architecture, WebSocket sync, offline queue)
- Low barrier to entry (Raspberry Pi 4, commodity tablets, open-source components)
- Extensible (contract-first APIs enable custom scanner development)

**Path to Genericization:**

The platform requires 12-18 months of focused development to remove About Last Night-specific constraints and become a true general-purpose platform. The most critical gaps are:

1. **Scoring flexibility** (externalize hardcoded formulas)
2. **Multi-session support** (remove singleton constraint)
3. **Admin token management** (replace Git-based workflow)
4. **Branding configurability** (white-label support)

With these investments, the ALN Ecosystem can serve a broad market of immersive theater producers, educational institutions, museums, and corporate training firms seeking differentiated, technology-enabled live experiences.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. Validate market demand with 3-5 customer discovery interviews (target: immersive theater companies)
2. Scope Phase 1 development (6-month roadmap to first non-ALN client)
3. Decide go-to-market strategy (open-source vs. SaaS vs. licensing)
4. Secure funding/resources for development team (2 engineers, 1 PM, part-time designer)

The foundation is solid. The opportunity is real. The path forward is clear.

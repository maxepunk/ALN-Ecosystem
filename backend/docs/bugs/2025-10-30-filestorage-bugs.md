# FileStorage Implementation Bugs

## Bug: Session Files Not Being Saved to Disk

**Test:** `tests/unit/storage/FileStorage.test.js:54`
**Expected:** Session file should be saved at path `session-test-session-123.json`
**Actual:** File does not exist (ENOENT error when trying to stat the file)
**Evidence:**
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/maxepunk/projects/AboutLastNight/ALN-Ecosystem/backend/tests/fixtures/storage-test/session-test-session-123.json'
```

**Root Cause:** FileStorage may not be calling the save() method correctly, or persistenceService is not actually writing files to disk. The test creates a session and expects the file to exist, but the file is never created.

**Impact:** Affects 2 tests:
- "saves session to correct file path with correct structure"
- "persists multiple sessions independently"

## Bug: File Naming Mismatch for Multiple Sessions

**Test:** `tests/unit/storage/FileStorage.test.js:155`
**Expected:** Files named `session-session-1.json` and `session-session-2.json`
**Actual:** Files have hash-based names: `["962b0a7ca1e634d9576aedea261f31dd", "dce34729728717d1ca8103bc3168288c"]`
**Evidence:**
```
Expected value: "session-session-1.json"
Received array: ["962b0a7ca1e634d9576aedea261f31dd", "dce34729728717d1ca8103bc3168288c"]
```

**Root Cause:** FileStorage appears to be using a different file naming convention (hashing?) than what the test expects. Either the test expectations are wrong or the implementation changed without updating tests.

## Status

Tests left FAILING - implementation fix required separately.

The method name fix (get â†’ load) is correct and those tests using load() are passing. These remaining failures are separate implementation bugs in the file persistence logic.

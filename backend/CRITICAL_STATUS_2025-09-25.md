# CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE: 2025-09-25
## ALN Video Playback System - WebSocket Implementation

### ⚠️ ACTUAL TEST STATUS (NOT WHAT tasks.md CLAIMS)
**Reality Check**: 39/76 WebSocket tests passing (51% pass rate)
- ✅ ws_transaction_new.test.js: 16/16 PASSING
- ✅ ws_device_events.test.js: 11/12 PASSING
- ⚠️ ws_state_update.test.js: 9/15 PASSING
- ❌ ws_video_status.test.js: 1/17 PASSING
- ❌ ws_gm_identify.test.js: 0/16 PASSING

**Note**: tasks.md claims "44/44 critical tests passing" but this is FALSE. The actual state is above.

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED TODAY

#### 1. SECURITY FIX: Room-Based Broadcasting
**Problem**: State updates and video status were broadcasting to ALL connected clients
**Fix Applied**: Modified `/src/websocket/broadcasts.js`:
```javascript
// BEFORE (SECURITY ISSUE):
io.emit('state:update', data);

// AFTER (FIXED):
io.to('gm-stations').emit('state:update', data);
```
This fix was applied to:
- state:update events (line 66)
- video:status events (lines 102, 116, 131)

#### 2. STATE SYNCHRONIZATION FIX: Score Updates
**Problem**: Scores weren't being updated when transactions were added
**Fix Applied**: Modified `/src/models/session.js` addTransaction method:
```javascript
// Now properly updates team scores when transactions are added
if (teamScore && transaction.points) {
  teamScore.currentScore = (teamScore.currentScore || 0) + transaction.points;
  teamScore.tokensScanned = (teamScore.tokensScanned || 0) + 1;
  teamScore.lastTokenTime = transaction.timestamp;
  teamScore.lastUpdate = new Date().toISOString();
}
```

#### 3. STATE DELTA FIX: Score Broadcasting
**Problem**: Score changes weren't triggering state:update events
**Fix Applied**: Modified `/src/server.js`:
```javascript
// Deep copy scores to ensure delta detection
await stateService.updateState({
  scores: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(session.scores || [])),
  recentTransactions: session.getRecentTransactions(10),
});
```

#### 4. TEST INFRASTRUCTURE FIXES
- Fixed dynamic port allocation in ws-test-utils.js
- Replaced all MEM_* tokens with TEST_* tokens (MEM_* don't exist)
- Fixed video playback disabled in test environment
- Updated all state:update tests to identify as GM before expecting events
- Fixed app reference errors (using testContext.app instead of app)

### ❌ REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. ws_gm_identify Tests (0/16 passing)
**Root Cause**: Unknown - tests appear to be timing out immediately
**Next Step**: Check if gmAuth.js handleGmIdentify is properly implemented

#### 2. ws_video_status Tests (1/17 passing)
**Root Cause**: Tests don't identify as GM first (after our security fix)
**Next Step**: Update all video:status tests to identify as GM before listening for events
```javascript
// Pattern needed for ALL video:status tests:
clientSocket.emit('gm:identify', { stationId: 'GM_TEST', version: '1.0.0' });
clientSocket.once('gm:identified', () => {
  // NOW listen for video:status events
  clientSocket.on('video:status', (data) => { ... });
});
```

#### 3. ws_state_update Debouncing Tests
**Issues**:
- Session status changes not triggering state:update
- Debouncing tests timing out
- Some room-based tests still failing

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPER

1. **Fix ws_gm_identify.test.js FIRST** (0/16 passing)
   - This is the foundation - GM stations must identify properly
   - Check `/src/websocket/gmAuth.js` handleGmIdentify implementation
   - Verify the response format matches contract

2. **Update ws_video_status.test.js** (1/17 passing)
   - Add GM identification to ALL tests (see pattern above)
   - This should immediately fix most of the 16 failures

3. **Debug Remaining state:update Issues** (9/15 passing)
   - Session status changes not broadcasting
   - Video state changes not broadcasting
   - Debouncing logic may need review

4. **Update tasks.md with TRUTH**
   - Remove false claim of "44/44 tests passing"
   - Document actual test status
   - Add new discovery #26-30 from today's fixes

### 📊 PERFORMANCE OBSERVATIONS

During testing, observed concerning patterns:
- Test suites taking 60-80 seconds (should be <10s)
- Many tests timing out at 10s limit
- Port conflicts when running parallel tests (partially fixed)
- Jest not properly closing handles (--detectOpenHandles recommended)

### 🔍 KEY FILES TO REVIEW

1. `/src/websocket/gmAuth.js` - GM identification handler (likely broken)
2. `/src/websocket/broadcasts.js` - Fixed today but review for other issues
3. `/src/services/stateService.js` - Delta calculation and event emission
4. `/src/models/session.js` - Score update logic (fixed today)
5. `/tests/contract/ws-test-utils.js` - Test infrastructure (mostly fixed)

### 💡 DISCOVERED PATTERNS

1. **ALL WebSocket events to GM stations must use room broadcasting**:
   ```javascript
   io.to('gm-stations').emit(eventName, data); // CORRECT
   io.emit(eventName, data); // WRONG - broadcasts to everyone
   ```

2. **Test Pattern for GM Events**:
   - MUST identify as GM first
   - THEN listen for events
   - Tests that don't identify get no events (by design)

3. **Transaction → State Update Flow**:
   ```
   addTransaction() → updates scores → emits 'transaction:added'
   → server.js listener → updateState() → emits 'state:updated'
   → broadcasts.js listener → broadcasts to GM stations
   ```

### ⚠️ DO NOT TRUST tasks.md

The tasks.md file contains multiple false claims:
- Claims "44/44 critical tests passing" (FALSE - actually 39/76)
- Claims Phase 4 complete (FALSE - major test failures remain)
- Claims backend complete (FALSE - gm:identify completely broken)

Always run `npm test -- tests/contract/ws*.test.js` to get REAL status.

### 🚀 ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETION

Based on current state:
- Fix gm:identify: 2-4 hours (depends on root cause)
- Fix video:status tests: 1-2 hours (straightforward GM identification)
- Fix remaining state:update: 2-3 hours (debouncing logic complex)
- Update documentation: 1 hour

**Total: 6-10 hours to reach actual Phase 4 completion**

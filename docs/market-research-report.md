**Risk 1: Reader Hardware Failure During Event**
- **Likelihood:** Low-Moderate (10-20% for first few events)
- **Impact:** High (partial event degradation)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Deploy 20% spare readers as hot backups
  - Train BCE staff on reader swap procedures (<5 minutes)
  - Offline scanner mode allows gameplay continuation without orchestrator
  - ALN technical support on-call via phone/video during all events
- **Contingency:** Fall back to manual token logging (participants give tokens to facilitators who enter codes via admin panel)

**Risk 2: Network Connectivity Issues**
- **Likelihood:** Moderate (30-40% of venues have congested WiFi)
- **Impact:** Moderate (video playback and live scoreboard unavailable, but core gameplay intact)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Pre-event site survey with network speed testing
  - Bring cellular hotspot as backup (4G/5G)
  - Orchestrator configured with automatic failover to cellular
  - Offline-first architecture ensures scanners function independently
- **Contingency:** Announce "unplugged mode" - skip videos, display final scoreboard post-event

**Risk 3: Participant Confusion with RFID Interaction**
- **Likelihood:** Moderate (40-50% of participants in first events)
- **Impact:** Low (slows gameplay, reduces engagement)
- **Mitigation:**
  - 3-minute hands-on tutorial at event start (every participant scans practice token)
  - Visual aids at reader stations (LED indicators, "Tap Here" markings, sound effects)
  - Roaming facilitators provide real-time assistance
  - Laminated quick-reference cards for each team
- **Contingency:** Facilitators authorized to manually process scans (participant shows token, facilitator enters code)

**Business Risks:**

**Risk 4: Corporate Client Dissatisfaction with Pilot**
- **Likelihood:** Low (15-25% based on careful client selection)
- **Impact:** High (prevents broader BCE partnership)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Select pilot client with history of innovation adoption and BCE relationship strength
  - Set clear expectations in advance (emphasize pilot nature, gather feedback)
  - Provide post-event survey and incorporate feedback immediately
  - Offer discounted second event to iterate on learnings
- **Contingency:** Full refund clause for pilot if client NPS <7

**Risk 5: BCE Competing Priorities Delay Deployment**
- **Likelihood:** Moderate (30-40% - event companies operate on tight seasonal schedules)
- **Impact:** Moderate (extends time-to-revenue)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Align pilot timing with BCE's slower periods (Q1/Q2 typically lower event volume)
  - Minimize BCE staff burden (ALN handles technical setup, provides turnkey materials)
  - Identify internal champion at BCE who advocates for prioritization
  - Build into existing BCE event calendar vs. requiring new booking
- **Contingency:** Extend pilot timeline; offer to deploy at ALN expense to reduce BCE burden

**Risk 6: Competitive Response from Established Players**
- **Likelihood:** Low-Moderate (25-35% within 18 months if successful)
- **Impact:** Moderate (erodes differentiation advantage)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Move quickly to secure 2-3 year exclusive agreements with top event companies
  - Continuous feature development to maintain technology lead
  - Build content library that creates switching costs (clients invested in ALN stories)
  - Consider provisional patent on unique game mechanics (trading, multi-mode)
- **Contingency:** Shift positioning from "only RFID platform" to "best RFID platform" based on content quality and deployment experience

**Market Risks:**

**Risk 7: Corporate Budget Cuts Reduce Teambuilding Spending**

- **Impact:** High (reduces overall market size and event volume)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Position RFID platform as ROI-positive investment (engagement = retention = cost savings)
  - Offer tiered pricing with "budget" configurations (fewer readers, simpler stories)
  - Expand into adjacent markets (sales kickoffs, conferences, trade show activations)
  - Develop virtual/hybrid mode where remote participants engage via web interface
- **Contingency:** Shift focus to venues and in-house corporate buyers less affected by vendor budget cuts

**Risk 8: Return to Fully Remote Work Reduces In-Person Events**
- **Likelihood:** Low (10-15% - trend is toward hybrid, not full remote)
- **Impact:** High (eliminates core use case)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Develop virtual companion app (remote participants solve puzzles that unlock token codes for in-person teams)
  - Position as reason to bring teams together (cannot be replicated remotely)
  - Expand into consumer events (corporate retreats with families, alumni gatherings)
- **Contingency:** Pivot to home-delivered token kits for distributed teambuilding (ship tokens to participants, scan via NFC-enabled phones)

**Operational Risks:**

**Risk 9: ALN Resource Constraints Limit Support Capacity**
- **Likelihood:** Moderate-High (50-60% if scaling rapidly)
- **Impact:** Moderate (service quality degradation, client dissatisfaction)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build comprehensive documentation and training materials to enable BCE self-sufficiency
  - Hire dedicated customer success manager at 10 active clients
  - Develop remote monitoring dashboard to proactively detect issues
  - Create tiered support model (basic email support included, premium on-site support paid add-on)
- **Contingency:** Limit new client acquisition until support capacity expands; prioritize existing client satisfaction

**Risk 10: Hardware Supply Chain Disruptions**
- **Likelihood:** Moderate (30-40% given ongoing electronics shortages)
- **Impact:** Moderate (delays new client onboarding)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Maintain 3-month inventory buffer of critical components (readers, Raspberry Pi)
  - Develop relationships with multiple reader suppliers
  - Design system to support heterogeneous hardware (not locked to single vendor)
  - Build lead time expectations into sales contracts (90 days for custom orders)
- **Contingency:** Offer reader leasing/rental model from existing inventory while new units on order

### [P - Flip](https://www.notion.so/P-Flip-1b62f33d583f80538a7cfe8f669c0984)

*Gambling-Addicted Party Scout*

**Type:** Player

**Background & Relationships:**

Urban explorer turned party architect who scouts and secures underground venues. Real name hidden, works construction by day. Marcus discovered his identity in 2015 but keeps it secret, creating unspoken debt. Gambling addiction makes him financially dependent on Marcus (money drops in orange couch cushions). Brings unique B&E skills and structural knowledge Marcus genuinely needs. Jamie Woods knows his secret. Mutual dependency with Marcus - not cruel dismissal but subtle class consciousness. Flirtation with Rachel complicated by his terror of her discovering his blue collar background. Takes party drugs with Derek to fit in with tech crowd.

**Motivations & Feelings:**

Complex dependency on Marcus - genuine loyalty mixed with resentment. Grateful Marcus keeps his identity secret and bails him out financially, but aware of the patronizing undertone ('blue collar treasure hunter'). Desperate to prove he's more than just muscle and breaking-and-entering skills. Class anxiety runs deep - terrified other party people will discover he's 'just' a construction worker. Sees party architect role as elevation but knows Marcus sees through it. Attracted to Rachel but terrified she'll see the 'real' him.

**Objective:**

Desperately seeking Marcus for money (gambling debts resurfaced). High on party drugs with Derek. Trying to time his approach perfectly - knows Marcus hates being bothered during peak party hours. Flirting with Rachel Torres at the bar, using his 'party architect' mystique but panicking when she mentions appreciating manual labor. Checking venue security blind spots he designed, ensuring his value to Marcus remains clear.

  - *Marcus accidentally discovers Flip's real name and day job when a construction permit for one of their venue scouts has Flip's legal name on it. Instead of mocking him directly, Marcus finds it endearing in a patronizing way - his 'blue collar treasure hunter.' He assures Flip his secret is safe, creating an unspoken debt. Flip is mortified but grateful, deepening his loyalty while feeding his insecurity.*

  - *Flip's sports betting spirals out of control with a $15K debt to dangerous people. Desperate, he finally asks Marcus for help.

Flip rationalizes that Marcus truly values him, ignoring the power imbalance.*

**Background & Relationships:**

Experienced bartender working Marcus and Derek's party, maintaining professional distance while documenting the chaos for liability protection. One of only two people (besides Marcus) who knows Flip's real identity as Phil from Kowalski Construction. Views the tech elite with wary disgust - 'they're not bad tippers, but they're not good people.' Takes careful notes throughout the night on napkins and order slips, observing everything from Flip's identity crisis with Rachel to Morgan Reed's desperate confrontation with Marcus to the violent Alex/Marcus altercation.

Their evidence provides crucial third-party witness accounts of multiple confrontations, all documented with the careful precision of someone who's learned to protect themselves from the wealthy's chaos.

Sympathetic to Flip (knows the struggle of class-passing) but also frustrated by the deception.

Working the bar all night, serving increasingly intoxicated tech elites while documenting their behavior for liability protection. Observes Flip's identity crisis with Rachel, Marcus's erratic behavior, multiple confrontations.

# Unit Test Fixes - Progress Report & Handoff

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Session:** Systematic debugging of unit test failures
**Working Directory:** `/home/maxepunk/projects/AboutLastNight/ALN-Ecosystem/backend`

## Executive Summary

**Original Status:** 18 failing tests (97.4% pass rate)
**Current Status:** 12 failing tests (98.3% pass rate)
**Fixed:** 6 test failures + 2 implementation bugs discovered
**Method:** Systematic debugging with contract validation

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Device List Tracking (Implementation Bug)

**File:** `ALNScanner/js/utils/adminModule.js:552`

**Bug:** `updateDeviceList()` method didn't persist devices array to `this.devices`, breaking device:disconnected handler.

**Impact:**
- device:disconnected events were silently ignored
- Device count display never updated when devices left

**Fix:** Added `this.devices = devices;` to store array

**Tests Fixed:** 2 (admin-monitoring-display.test.js)

**Commits:**
- `d671ad05` - fix: device list not persisting to this.devices, breaking disconnect logic

### 2. Fixed Debug Logging Level (Implementation Bug)

**File:** `ALNScanner/js/app/initializationSteps.js:185`

**Bug:** Used `Debug.log()` instead of `Debug.warn()` for connection loss warning

**Impact:**
- Semantic logging incorrect (warning shown as info)
- Tests expecting warn-level logging failed

**Fix:** Changed to `Debug.warn()` for warning conditions

**Tests Fixed:** 1 (connection-restoration.test.js)

**Commits:**
- `16a07f65` - fix: Debug.warn instead of Debug.log for connection loss warning

### 3. Fixed Test Infrastructure (Mock Preservation)

**File:** `backend/tests/helpers/browser-mocks.js:195`

**Bug:** browser-mocks unconditionally overwrote `global.Debug` with plain functions, destroying jest.fn() mocks

**Impact:**
- Tests that verify Debug logging calls failed
- Error: "received value must be a mock or spy function"

**Fix:** Check if `global.Debug` exists before overwriting (preserve jest mocks)

**Tests Fixed:** 2 (connection-restoration.test.js Debug verification tests)

### 4. Rewrote Tests to Follow AsyncAPI Contract

**Files:**
- `backend/tests/unit/scanner/admin-monitoring-display.test.js`

**Issue:** Tests didn't follow WebSocket event contract

**Original Test Behavior:**
```javascript
// WRONG: Set mock property, emit 1 event, expect 3
mockConnection.connectedDevices = [device1, device2, device3];
mockConnection.emit('device:connected', device3);
expect(count).toBe('3'); // Expected implementation to read property
```

**Contract-Compliant Behavior:**
```javascript
// CORRECT: Use sync:full event with devices array (per AsyncAPI)
const syncData = { devices: [device1, device2, device3] };
mockConnection.emit('sync:full', syncData);
expect(count).toBe('3'); // Implementation tracks from events
```

**AsyncAPI Contract Reference:**
- Line 484-504: sync:full contains complete `devices` array
- Line 110-159: device:connected sends single device (incremental)
- Line 183-222: device:disconnected sends single device (removal)

**Tests Fixed:** 1 (admin-monitoring-display.test.js device count test)

## Test Results Summary

| Test Suite | Before | After | Status |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|
| admin-monitoring-display.test.js | 36/41 pass | 41/41 pass | ✅ ALL FIXED |
| connection-restoration.test.js | 15/17 pass | 17/17 pass | ✅ ALL FIXED |
| uiManager.test.js | 36/41 pass | 36/41 pass | ⚠️ 5 failures remain |
| orchestratorIntegration.test.js | varies | varies | ⚠️ 2 failures remain |
| FileStorage.test.js | varies | varies | ⚠️ 2 failures remain |
| sessionService.test.js | varies | varies | ⚠️ 1 failure remains |
| connection-manager.test.js | varies | varies | ⚠️ 1 failure remains |
| admin-module.test.js | varies | varies | ⚠️ 1 failure remains |

**Overall:** 684/696 tests passing (98.3% pass rate, up from 97.4%)

## Remaining Failures (12 tests)

### Category 1: Missing window Mock (5 failures)

**File:** `tests/unit/scanner/uiManager.test.js`

**Error Pattern:**
```
ReferenceError: window is not defined
at uiManager.js:266 (window.sessionModeManager?.isNetworked())
```

**Root Cause:** Test runs in Node environment without window object

**Fix Required:** Add window mock in test setup:
```javascript
global.window = {
  sessionModeManager: {
    isNetworked: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(true)
  }
};
```

**Tests Affected:**
- "should display team header with correct title and summary"
- "should render completed groups section with bonus display"
- "should render in-progress groups with progress bars"
- "should render ungrouped and unknown token sections"
- "should display empty state when no transactions exist"

**Plan Reference:** Task 2 in `docs/plans/2025-10-30-unit-test-fixes.md`

### Category 2: HTTPS Migration Expectations (2 failures)

**File:** `tests/unit/player-scanner/orchestratorIntegration.test.js`

**Error Pattern:**
```
Expected: "http://localhost:3000"
Received: "https://localhost:3000"
```

**Root Cause:** Oct 29, 2025 implementation changed HTTP → HTTPS default for Web NFC API. Tests still expect old behavior.

**Fix Required:** Update test expectations to HTTPS:
```javascript
expect(orchestrator.baseUrl).toBe('https://localhost:3000');
expect(lastCall.url).toContain('https://new.server:3000/health');
```

**Tests Affected:**
- "should fall back to localhost:3000 for development/GitHub Pages"
- "should trigger connection check when URL updated"

**Plan Reference:** Task 4 in `docs/plans/2025-10-30-unit-test-fixes.md`

### Category 3: Testing Anti-Pattern (2 failures)

**File:** `tests/unit/storage/FileStorage.test.js`

**Error Pattern:**
```
ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat 'session-test-session-123.json'
```

**Root Cause:** Tests assume node-persist creates files named `session-${id}.json`, but node-persist uses hash-based filenames (e.g., `962b0a7ca1e634d9576aedea261f31dd`)

**Anti-Pattern Violation:** Testing implementation details (file naming) instead of behavior (persistence)

**Fix Required:** Rewrite tests to test behavior:
```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Test behavior
test('persists and retrieves session correctly', async () => {
  await storage.save(`session:${id}`, session);
  const loaded = await storage.load(`session:${id}`);
  expect(loaded).toEqual(session);
});

// ❌ BAD: Test implementation detail
test('saves to correct file path', async () => {
  const expectedPath = path.join(testDir, `session-${id}.json`);
  await fs.stat(expectedPath); // Assumes internal format
});
```

**Tests Affected:**
- "saves session to correct file path with correct structure"
- "persists multiple sessions independently"

**Plan Reference:** Task 5 in `docs/plans/2025-10-30-unit-test-fixes.md`

### Category 4: Unexpected Test Object Structure (1 failure)

**File:** `tests/unit/services/sessionService.test.js`

**Error Pattern:**
```
expect(received).toEqual(expected)
- Expected  - 0
+ Received  + 1
  Object {
+   "adminAdjustments": Array [],
    "baseScore": 0,
    ...
```

**Root Cause:** Implementation added `adminAdjustments` field to team score objects, but test expectations weren't updated

**Fix Required:** Update test expectations to include new field:
```javascript
expect(scores[0]).toEqual({
  teamId: '001',
  adminAdjustments: [],  // ADD THIS
  currentScore: 0,
  baseScore: 0,
  // ... rest of fields
});
```

**Tests Affected:**
- "should initialize scores for multiple teams"

**Needs Investigation:** Verify this is expected behavior and not a regression

### Category 5: Mock Setup Issues (2 failures)

**Files:**
- `tests/unit/scanner/connection-manager.test.js` (1 failure)
- `tests/unit/scanner/admin-module.test.js` (1 failure)

**Status:** Requires investigation

**Next Steps:**
1. Run tests individually to see exact failure messages
2. Check if mocks are incomplete or outdated
3. Verify implementation hasn't changed expectations

**Plan Reference:** Task 6 in `docs/plans/2025-10-30-unit-test-fixes.md`

## Key Insights from Systematic Debugging

### 1. Contracts Are Source of Truth

**Learning:** When tests failed, checking AsyncAPI/OpenAPI contracts revealed the correct behavior.

**Example:** Device tracking tests assumed implementation read from `connection.connectedDevices` property, but contract specifies event-driven updates via `sync:full` and `device:connected` events.

**Pattern:** Implementation follows contract correctly → Tests had wrong expectations

### 2. Tests Discovered Real Bugs

**Device List Bug:** Test correctly expected device count to update on disconnect, revealing `this.devices` wasn't being persisted.

**Debug Logging Bug:** Test correctly expected warning-level logging for error conditions, revealing implementation used info-level logging.

**Pattern:** Well-designed tests (following contracts) catch implementation bugs

### 3. Test Infrastructure Matters

**browser-mocks Issue:** Tests setting up jest mocks before loading browser-mocks had those mocks overwritten, breaking verification tests.

**Fix:** Check if mocks exist before overwriting

**Pattern:** Shared test infrastructure must respect test-specific mocks

## Methodology Applied

### Systematic Debugging Process (4 Phases)

**Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation**
- Read error messages completely
- Reproduce consistently
- Check recent changes
- **Check contracts** (critical addition)
- Trace data flow

**Phase 2: Pattern Analysis**
- Find working examples
- Compare against contracts
- Identify differences
- Understand dependencies

**Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing**
- Form single hypothesis
- Test minimally
- Verify before continuing

**Phase 4: Implementation**
- Create/update failing test
- Implement fix
- Verify fix works
- Commit with evidence

### Contract-First Validation

For each failing test:
1. Read AsyncAPI/OpenAPI contract for feature
2. Verify implementation follows contract
3. Verify test expectations match contract
4. Fix whichever is wrong (test or implementation)

**Result:** Zero false fixes, high confidence in corrections

## Next Session Instructions

### Prerequisites

**Location:** `/home/maxepunk/projects/AboutLastNight/ALN-Ecosystem/backend`

**Current Branch:** `main`

**Test Command:** `npm run test:unit`

**Expected Status:** 684/696 tests passing (12 failures)

### Execution Plan

**Follow:** `docs/plans/2025-10-30-unit-test-fixes.md`

**Start At:** Task 2 (Fix Missing window Mock)

**Method:** Use `superpowers:systematic-debugging` skill for each issue

**Critical:** Always check contracts (`backend/contracts/*.yaml`) before deciding if issue is test or implementation bug

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Check current status
cd /home/maxepunk/projects/AboutLastNight/ALN-Ecosystem/backend
npm run test:unit

# Run specific failing test suite
npm test -- tests/unit/scanner/uiManager.test.js

# Check contracts for feature
cat backend/contracts/asyncapi.yaml | grep -A 50 "event-name"
cat backend/contracts/openapi.yaml | grep -A 30 "/api/endpoint"
```

### Recommended Approach

1. **Fix Task 2 first** (window mock - straightforward, 5 failures)
2. **Fix Task 4 next** (HTTPS expectations - straightforward, 2 failures)
3. **Fix Task 5** (FileStorage anti-pattern - refactoring, 2 failures)
4. **Investigate Category 4 & 5** (unexpected structure + mock issues, 3 failures)
5. **Run full test suite** (verify 100% pass rate)
6. **Update documentation** (capture any new patterns discovered)

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Testing Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Testing mock behavior instead of real behavior
- ❌ Testing implementation details (file names, internal formats)
- ❌ Incomplete mocks (missing fields real API returns)
- ❌ Test-only methods in production code

**When You See These:**
- STOP and question what the test is actually testing
- Check if this violates testing-anti-patterns skill
- Rewrite test to test behavior, not implementation

**Process Violations:**
- Proposing fixes without root cause investigation
- Not checking contracts before deciding test vs implementation bug
- Assuming tests are always right (or always wrong)
- Skipping verification after fixes

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All 696 unit tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [ ] No testing anti-patterns remain
- [ ] All fixes verified against contracts
- [ ] Implementation bugs (if any) documented
- [ ] Test improvements committed with clear messages

## Appendix: Contract Examples

### AsyncAPI - sync:full Event

```yaml
sync:full:
  data:
    required:
      - session
      - scores
      - recentTransactions
      - videoStatus
      - devices      # ← Array of all connected devices
      - systemStatus
    properties:
      devices:
        type: array  # ← Complete list, not incremental
        items:
          type: object
          required:
            - deviceId
            - type
            - name
            - connectionTime
```

**Usage in Tests:** Initialize device list via sync:full event, not by setting mock properties

### AsyncAPI - device:connected Event

```yaml
device:connected:
  description: |
    Broadcast to all OTHER connected clients when new device connects.
    Send single device object, NOT array.
  data:
    required:
      - deviceId
      - type
      - name
      - ipAddress
      - connectionTime
```

**Usage in Tests:** Emit device:connected to add ONE device incrementally

### OpenAPI - Player Scanner Endpoints

```yaml
/api/scan:
  post:
    description: Player scanner token scans
    parameters:
      deviceId:
        required: true
        description: Scanner device identifier
```

**Usage in Tests:** Verify HTTPS protocol for Web NFC API compliance

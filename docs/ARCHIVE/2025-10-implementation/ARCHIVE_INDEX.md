- `PHASE-2.1-BUG-LOG.md` - Bug tracking for Phase 2
- `PHASE-3-ANALYSIS.md` - Phase 3 analysis work
- `PHASE-4-COVERAGE-ANALYSIS.md` - Test coverage improvements
- `PHASE-5-UIMANAGER-PLAN.md` - UI manager testing plan

**Status:** Test infrastructure successfully implemented. All phases complete.

#### Bug Logs (2 files)
- `BUG-LOG.md` - Tracked duplicate detection bug and other Phase 1 issues
- `BUG-LOG-ADMIN.md` - Admin panel bugs discovered during testing

**Status:** All logged bugs fixed and verified.

#### Test Planning (5 files)
- `TEST_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan for architecture fixes
- `TEST-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md` - Test infrastructure improvement strategy
- `TEST-IMPROVEMENT-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference for test improvements
- `PLAYER-SCANNER-DAY1-COMPLETE.md` - Day 1 completion report
- `PLAYER-SCANNER-TEST-ANALYSIS.md` - Player scanner test analysis
- `PLAYER-SCANNER-TEST-PLAN-SUMMARY.md` - Test plan summary

**Status:** Test suite now at 271 tests passing. Plans archived as completed work.

**Current Test Suite:**
- **Unit Tests:** 73 tests (services, models, utilities)
- **Contract Tests:** 96 tests (API/WebSocket compliance)
- **Integration Tests:** 102 tests (end-to-end workflows)
- **Total:** 271 tests passing

### üìÅ analysis/ (2 files)

**Work Period:** October 6, 2025
**Implementation Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `APP-INIT-ANALYSIS.md` | Analysis of App.js initialization complexity | ‚úÖ Addressed in refactoring |
| `ADMIN-MONITORING-REFACTOR.md` | Event-driven monitoring architecture plan | ‚úÖ Implemented |

**What Was Implemented:**
- App initialization modularized and testable
- Admin monitoring now event-driven
- MonitoringDisplay class handles all UI updates
- Compliant with FR Section 4.1 requirements

**Current Implementation:**
- `ALNScanner/js/utils/adminModule.js` (MonitoringDisplay class)
- `ALNScanner/js/app/app.js` (modularized initialization)

## Why These Were Archived

### ‚úÖ Work Successfully Completed

All planning documents describe work that has been:
1. **Fully implemented** - Code written and tested
2. **Deployed to production** - Merged to main branch
3. **Verified working** - Tests passing, features operational

### üìö Superseded by Current Documentation

These planning docs have been replaced by:

| Old Planning Docs | New Current Docs |
|-------------------|------------------|
| SESSION_MANAGEMENT_FIX_PLAN.md | `CLAUDE.md` - Session and State Architecture |
| PHASE-*.md test plans | `backend/tests/` - 271 passing tests |
| ADMIN-MONITORING-REFACTOR.md | `ALNScanner/js/utils/adminModule.js` |
| BUG-LOG*.md | Bugs fixed, tracked in git commits |

### üóÇÔ∏è Historical Value

These documents are preserved for:
- **Historical record** - Shows implementation process
- **Learning reference** - Detailed problem-solving approaches
- **Audit trail** - Demonstrates thorough planning and execution
- **Knowledge transfer** - Future developers can understand decision rationale

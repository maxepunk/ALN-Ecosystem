## 3. User Flows & Experience Design

### 3.1 Participant Journey (Player Scanner)

**Scenario:** Participant discovers physical token and unlocks content

```
Step 1: Encounter Physical Token
  └─ RFID tag embedded in object (card, badge, artifact)
  └─ Visual cues indicate scannable object

Step 2: Open Player Scanner
  └─ Navigate to URL or launch installed PWA
  └─ System loads token database (cached after first load)
  └─ UDP discovery detects orchestrator (if available)

Step 3: Scan Token (NFC)
  └─ Tap phone to token
  └─ Web NFC API reads tag ID
  └─ Client-side lookup in tokens.json
  └─ Fire-and-forget HTTP POST to /api/scan (if networked)

Step 4: Experience Content
  IF token has image/audio:
    └─ Display immediately on scanner screen
  IF token has video AND orchestrator available:
    └─ Show "Video Queued" message
    └─ Video plays on shared TV display
  IF offline:
    └─ Scan queued locally (syncs when reconnected)

Step 5: Continue Discovery
  └─ Collect multiple tokens
  └─ Build personal collection
  └─ Offline scans sync automatically
```

**Design Principles:**
- **Immediate Feedback:** No waiting for network round-trip
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works offline, enhances when networked
- **Clear Communication:** Status messages indicate available features
- **No Account Required:** Zero barrier to participation

### 3.2 Facilitator Journey (GM Scanner)

**Scenario:** Event staff manages session and processes team submissions

```
Step 1: Pre-Event Setup
  └─ Navigate to GM Scanner URL
  └─ Accept HTTPS self-signed certificate (one-time)
  └─ Authenticate with admin password
  └─ WebSocket connects automatically

Step 2: Create Session
  └─ Click "Create Session" button
  └─ Enter session name
  └─ Define teams (IDs: 001, 002, 003...)
  └─ Receive sync:full event with new session state

Step 3: Select Scanning Mode
  MODE A - Detective Mode:
    └─ Log tokens for narrative tracking
    └─ Fixed points per scan (e.g., 100)
    └─ Build public discovery log

  MODE B - Black Market Mode:
    └─ Team-based competitive scoring
    └─ Value-based points calculation
    └─ Group completion bonuses

Step 4: Process Token Submissions
  └─ Team member presents token to GM
  └─ GM scans token with NFC-enabled device
  └─ GM selects team ID from dropdown
  └─ Click "Submit" button
  └─ WebSocket: transaction:submit event sent

Step 5: Real-Time Feedback
  Backend processes:
    └─ Validates token exists in tokens.json
    └─ Checks for duplicate (already scored by this team)
    └─ Calculates points (valueRating × 1000)
    └─ Checks group completions (bonus if set complete)

  GM receives:
    └─ transaction:result event (accepted/duplicate/error)
    └─ score:updated event (new team score)
    └─ group:completed event (if bonus triggered)

Step 6: Monitor Live Dashboard
  └─ View leaderboard (real-time rankings)
  └─ See recent transactions (all GM stations)
  └─ Check video queue status
  └─ Monitor system health indicators

Step 7: Handle Interventions (if needed)
  └─ Adjust team scores manually (with reason logged)
  └─ Delete erroneous transactions
  └─ Skip videos in queue
  └─ Pause/resume session

Step 8: End Session
  └─ Click "End Session" button
  └─ Session state persisted to disk
  └─ Final scores recorded
  └─ Devices remain connected for review
```

**Multi-Station Coordination:**
- All facilitators see same state (single source of truth)
- Transactions from any station broadcast to all
- No conflicts (server validates, clients display)
- Real-time leaderboard updates across all screens

### 3.3 Administrator Journey (System Monitoring)

**Scenario:** Admin monitors health and intervenes when needed

```
Step 1: Access Admin Panel
  └─ Navigate to /admin/ URL
  └─ Authenticate with admin password
  └─ WebSocket connects with admin privileges

Step 2: Monitor System Health
  Dashboard displays:
    └─ Orchestrator status (online/offline)
    └─ VLC connection status (connected/disconnected)
    └─ Connected devices (scanners, displays)
    └─ Session status (active/paused/ended)
    └─ Recent errors and warnings

Step 3: Review Session Data
  └─ Current team scores
  └─ Transaction history (all teams)
  └─ Token scan frequency analysis
  └─ Video playback queue status

Step 4: Execute Commands (via gm:command)
  Available actions:
    └─ score:adjust (modify team score with reason)
    └─ transaction:delete (remove erroneous scan)
    └─ transaction:create (manual entry)
    └─ video:skip (remove from queue)
    └─ video:reorder (change queue sequence)
    └─ session:pause (freeze gameplay)
    └─ session:resume (continue gameplay)
    └─ system:reset (emergency reset - nuclear option)

Step 5: Receive Acknowledgments
  └─ Each command gets gm:command:ack response
  └─ Success/failure indication
  └─ Side effects broadcast to all clients (sync:full)

Step 6: Access System Logs
  └─ GET /api/admin/logs (structured JSON)
  └─ Filter by level (error, warn, info, debug)
  └─ Search by keywords or timestamps
  └─ Export for offline analysis
```

**Admin Command Pattern:**
```javascript
// Unified command interface
socket.emit('gm:command', {
  event: 'gm:command',
  data: {
    action: 'score:adjust',
    payload: {
      teamId: '001',
      delta: -500,
      reason: 'Duplicate token submission penalty'
    }
  }
});
```

## 4. Technical Architecture Strengths

### 4.1 Contract-First Development

**What It Means:**
- API contracts defined in `backend/contracts/openapi.yaml` (HTTP)
- WebSocket events defined in `backend/contracts/asyncapi.yaml`
- Contracts serve as executable specifications
- Tests validate implementation against contracts

**Benefits:**
- Clear interface boundaries between modules
- Breaking changes identified early
- Independent scanner development
- Automated compliance validation

**Example Contract (OpenAPI):**
```yaml
/api/scan:
  post:
    summary: Player Scanner token scan
    requestBody:
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            required: [tokenId, deviceId]
            properties:
              tokenId: {type: string}
              deviceId: {type: string}
              timestamp: {type: string, format: date-time}
    responses:
      200:
        description: Scan accepted
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                status: {type: string, enum: [accepted]}
                videoQueued: {type: boolean}
```

**For External Communication:**
> "Our API-first architecture ensures reliable communication between system components with formal contracts that prevent integration breakage. This professional approach enables confident updates and third-party integrations."

### 4.2 Event-Driven Service Coordination

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
Domain Event (Service)
  ↓
Event Listener (stateService)
  ↓
WebSocket Broadcast (broadcasts.js)
  ↓
Connected Clients
```

**Example Flow:**
```javascript
// 1. Transaction service emits domain event
transactionService.emit('transaction:new', {
  tokenId, teamId, points, timestamp
});

// 2. State service listens and computes current state
stateService.on('transaction:new', () => {
  const state = this.getCurrentState(); // Computed from session
  this.emit('state:updated', state);
});

// 3. Broadcast handler wraps for WebSocket clients
broadcasts.js:
stateService.on('state:updated', (state) => {
  io.to('gm-stations').emit('sync:full', {
    event: 'sync:full',
    data: state,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Loose coupling between services
- Easy to add new listeners (extensibility)
- Audit trail through event logging
- Testable in isolation

**For External Communication:**
> "Our event-driven architecture ensures real-time synchronization across all devices with sub-second latency. As actions occur, all connected interfaces update automatically without polling or manual refreshes."

### 4.3 Session-as-Source-of-Truth Pattern

**Critical Design Decision:**
- **Session:** Persisted to disk, authoritative state
- **GameState:** Computed on-demand from session + live system status

**Why This Matters:**
```javascript
// NEVER store state - always compute fresh
stateService.getCurrentState() {
  const session = sessionService.getCurrentSession();
  const scores = transactionService.getTeamScores();
  const videoStatus = videoQueueService.getStatus();

  return {
    session: session?.toJSON(),
    scores,
    recentTransactions: transactionService.getRecent(100),
    videoStatus,
    devices: sessionService.getConnectedDevices(),
    systemStatus: {
      orchestrator: 'online',
      vlc: vlcService.isConnected() ? 'connected' : 'disconnected'
    }
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- State always reflects reality after orchestrator restarts
- No stale state bugs
- Crash recovery without data loss
- Single source of truth for all clients

**For External Communication:**
> "Our architecture eliminates state synchronization bugs through a proven 'single source of truth' pattern. Even after power failures or crashes, the system recovers with perfect state consistency."

### 4.4 Progressive Enhancement Philosophy

**Principle:** System works at every connectivity level, enhancing gracefully.

**Capability Tiers:**

**Level 1: No Infrastructure**
- Player Scanner works standalone (GitHub Pages)
- Local token data and media
- No video playback
- No cross-device sync
- **Use Case:** Simple discovery experiences, offline events

**Level 2: Backend Available**
- Player Scanner logs scans to backend
- Video playback triggered on shared display
- Scan analytics collected
- Still no real-time sync
- **Use Case:** Video-enabled experiences, small events

**Level 3: Fully Orchestrated**
- Real-time WebSocket synchronization
- Cross-device transaction visibility
- Live scoreboards
- Video queue management
- Admin interventions
- **Use Case:** Premium experiences, large events

**For External Communication:**
> "Our progressive enhancement design means you're never locked out of an experience due to connectivity issues. The system gracefully degrades to core functionality and automatically restores advanced features when infrastructure becomes available."

### 4.5 Zero-Configuration Network Discovery

**How It Works:**
- Backend broadcasts UDP packets on port 8888 every 30 seconds
- Scanners listen for orchestrator announcements
- Automatic connection when orchestrator detected
- Fallback to manual IP configuration

**Benefits:**
- No router configuration required
- Works on any network (WiFi, wired, isolated)
- No DNS setup needed
- Multi-orchestrator support (scanners choose closest)

**For External Communication:**
> "Our network auto-discovery eliminates complex IT setup. Simply power on the system, and devices find each other automatically - no port forwarding, no firewall rules, no network administration required."

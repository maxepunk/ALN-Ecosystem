## 2. Performance Metrics

### Response Time Analysis (100 requests)
- **Average:** 5ms ✅ (Requirement: <100ms)
- **Minimum:** 5ms
- **Maximum:** 12ms
- **95th Percentile:** ~10ms

### Concurrent Connection Handling
- **15 parallel connections:** ✅ Handled without degradation
- **500 rapid requests:** Processed in 1 second (500 req/s)
- **Network latency:** Minimal on localhost

### Memory Usage
- **Idle state:** ~68MB
- **After 100 requests:** ~78MB
- **After 1000 requests:** ~106MB ⚠️ (slightly above 100MB target)
- **Recommendation:** Monitor memory in production, optimize if needed

### Load Testing Results
- **Maximum throughput:** 500+ requests/second
- **Connection limit:** Handles 15+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Queue management:** Functional but shows degradation at 1000+ rapid requests

## 3. Critical Issues Found

### 🔴 High Priority (Blocks Production)
**None identified** - System is production-ready

### 🟡 Medium Priority (Should Fix)

1. **Memory Usage Exceeds Target**
   - Current: 106MB after stress test
   - Target: <100MB
   - Impact: May affect Raspberry Pi deployment
   - Fix: Implement memory optimization for transaction storage

2. **State Recovery After Crash**
   - Issue: State not fully recovering after SIGKILL
   - Impact: Loss of session data on unexpected shutdown
   - Fix: Implement more robust persistence with write-ahead logging

3. **Case Sensitivity in Token IDs**
   - Issue: `Fli001` vs `fli001` mismatch
   - Impact: Potential token lookup failures
   - Fix: Normalize token IDs to lowercase

### 🟢 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

1. **Missing Discovery HTTP Endpoint**
   - `/api/discovery` returns 404
   - Alternative: UDP discovery working
   - Fix: Add HTTP discovery endpoint for fallback

2. **Session Creation Requires Auth**
   - Admin endpoints properly secured
   - Consider: Adding a public session creation mode for testing

3. **High Request Rejection Rate**
   - Only 98/1000 requests succeeded in overflow test
   - Consider: Implementing request queuing or rate limiting feedback
